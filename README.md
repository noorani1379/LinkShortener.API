# LinkShortener.API
 
A simple URL shortener built with **.NET 9** using **Minimal API** and **Vertical Slice Architecture**. The project stores links in memory (for demonstration) and separates each feature—such as creating and redirecting links—into its own “slice,” making the code clean, maintainable, and easy to extend.
